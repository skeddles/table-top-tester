## Server Documentation

This README file provides information about the server-side implementation of the Tabletop Playtester application.

### Overview

The server is built using Express.js and Socket.io, providing a robust backend for handling API requests and real-time updates for the game state. The server can be run independently of the client, allowing for flexible deployment options.

### Features

- API for managing game sessions and state
- Real-time communication using Socket.io
- TypeScript for static type checking
- Unit testing with Jest

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the server directory: `cd server`
3. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the server.

### Directory Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the server.
  - `controllers/`: Contains controllers for handling API requests.
  - `routes/`: Contains route definitions for the server.
  - `types/`: Contains TypeScript interfaces and types.
  - `app.ts`: The main entry point for the server application.

### Running Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:

```
npm test
```

### Deployment

The server can be deployed on any cloud provider that supports Node.js applications. Ensure that the necessary environment variables are set for production use.
